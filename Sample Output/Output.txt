ANALYSIS BY TECHNICAL RECRUITER
================================

1. EXTRACTED TECHNICAL SKILLS (FROM THE RESUME TEXT)

Based strictly on what is written:

- Programming (basic knowledge) – unspecified language(s)
- Artificial Intelligence (interest) – interest only, not a skill

Reality check:
There are no concrete, verifiable technical skills listed.
Recruiters score skills on evidence, not intent.


2. MISSING IMPORTANT SKILLS (CRITICAL GAPS)

For a final-year Computer Science student, these are expected and currently missing:

Core CS & Programming
- At least one programming language (Python / Java / C++ / JavaScript)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

AI / Tech Path (since AI interest is mentioned)
- Python for AI
- NumPy, Pandas
- Basic Machine Learning concepts
- Any AI/ML library (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)

Practical Proof
- Projects (academic or personal)
- Git / GitHub
- Basic SQL or databases

Resume Fundamentals
- Education details (degree, university, year)
- Tools, platforms, or coursework
- Outcomes (what was built or learned)


3. RESUME SCORE (OUT OF 100)

Score: 8 / 100

Reasoning:
- No measurable skills
- No technologies named
- No projects
- No proof of ability
- Reads like an introduction, not a resume

This resume would be rejected in under 5 seconds by ATS or recruiters.


4. FIVE HIGH-IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS

1) Replace the summary with a skill-backed profile

Bad:
"basic knowledge of programming and interest in AI"

Better:
"Final-year Computer Science student skilled in Python and SQL, with hands-on experience building ML models and data analysis projects."

2) Explicitly list programming languages
Recruiters scan for keywords.
Examples:
- Python
- Java
- C++
- SQL

3) Add at least two small projects
Examples:
- Spam classifier using Python
- Stock price prediction using ML
- Student management system (Java)

4) Create a dedicated Skills section

Example:
Technical Skills:
- Languages: Python, Java
- ML: Linear Regression, Classification
- Tools: Git, VS Code
- Databases: MySQL

5) Stop using vague words

Avoid:
- basic knowledge
- interest in
- familiar with

Use:
- implemented
- built
- analyzed
- developed


FINAL VERDICT

You are not underqualified.
Your resume is underwritten.

With proper structure and skills, this resume can be improved from 8/100 to 75+ within 2–3 months.
